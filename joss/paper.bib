abstract = {Abstract Structural studies of proteins are critical for understanding biological processes at the molecular level. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for obtaining structural and dynamic information on proteins and protein-ligand complexes. In the present review, methodologies for NMR structure determination of proteins and macromolecular complexes are described. In addition, a number of recent advances that reduce the molecular weight limitations previously imposed on NMR studies of biomolecules are discussed, highlighting applications of these technologies to protein systems studied in our laboratories.},

The choice of approach to use for atomic model building, fitting, refinement and validation in the 3D map resulting from these experiments depends primarily on the resolution of the map and the prior information on the corresponding model. Here, we survey some of such methods and approaches and highlight their uses in specific recent examples.}

abstract = {The roles of unfolded states of proteins in normal folding and in diseases involving aggregation, as well as the prevalence and regulatory functions of intrinsically disordered proteins, have become increasingly recognized. The structural representation of these disordered states as ensembles of interconverting conformers can therefore provide critical insights. Experimental methods can be used to probe ensemble-averaged structural properties of disordered states and computational approaches generate representative ensembles of conformers using experimental restraints. In particular, NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering provide quantitative data that can readily be incorporated into calculations. These techniques have gleaned structural information about denatured, unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins. The use of experimental data in different computational approaches, including ensemble molecular dynamics simulations and algorithms that assign populations to pregenerated conformers, has highlighted the presence of both local and long-range structure, and the occurrence of native-like and non-native interactions in unfolded and denatured states. Analysis of the resulting ensembles has suggested important implications of this fluctuating structure for folding, aggregation and binding.}

abstract = {Summary
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play fundamental roles in signaling, regulation, and cell homeostasis by specifically interacting with their partners. The structural characterization of these interacting regions remains challenging and requires the integration of extensive experimental information. Here we present an approach that exploits the structural information encoded in tripeptide fragments from coil regions of high-resolution structures. Our results indicate that a simple building approach that disregards the sequence context provides a good structural representation of fully disordered regions. Conversely, the description of partially structured motifs calls for the consideration of sequence-dependent structural preferences. By using nuclear magnetic resonance residual dipolar couplings and small-angle X-ray scattering data for multiple IDPs we demonstrate that the appropriate combination of these two building strategies produces ensemble models that correctly describe the secondary structural classes and the population of partially structured regions. This study paves the way for the extension of structure prediction and protein design to disordered proteins.}
