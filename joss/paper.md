# Summary


# Implementation


# Installation

To install **spycipdb**, follow the instructions provided on the corresponding documentation
webpage or `docs/installation.rst` in the repository. As **spycipdb** is written completely in Python,
it's comptable with any platform able to execute Python (>=3.8 but <4.0). However, certain third-party
extensions to perform back-calculations (SAXS and RDC) have only been tested on 64-bit Ubuntu 
18.04.X LTS and 20.04.X LTS, as well as WSL 2.0 on 64-bit Windows 11. It is recommended to read the
detailed installation and troubleshooting documentation before using Anaconda or virtualenv
to install and configure **spycipdb**.

# Use cases

The current version of **spycipdb** has eight command-line modules that execute different
back-calculation routines for .PDB formatted protein structure files. Usage examples, along
with input/output formats are provided both in the project's documentation hosted on ReadTheDocs
as well as by the command:

```bash
$ spycipdb -h
```

To showcase the built-in PRE module, `pre` is used to back-calculate PRE distances
given an experimental data template:

```bash
$ spycipdb pre /path/pdbs/ -e pdbs_PRE.txt -n 16 -o bc_pdbs_PRE.json
```

Where users could specify a directory or tarball (.TAR) with `N` number of .PDBs and an experimental file
template `--exp-file`,`-e`, along with how many cores/workers to use `--ncores`,`-n` and the output file
`--output`,`-o`.

# Acknowledgements

The motivation behind this project was to create a modular-yet-standalone software package to back-calculate
experimental datatypes for conformers generated by the IDPConformerGenerator [@idpconfgen] platform. The author
